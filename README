Net-Growl version 0.99

Net::Growl provieds simple interface to send Mac OS X Growl notifications across the network. 

Growl only needs to be installed on the  Mac receiving notification not on the machine using this module.  

Make sure to go to System Preferences -> Growl -> Network and:
1) Enable incoming notifications
2) Allow remote applications (depending on your code this may be optional)
3) Add a server password


INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
    
Then go to System Preferences -> Growl -> Network and:

    Enable incoming notifications
    Allow remote applications (depending on your code this may be optional)
    Add a server password

You can test the install by running ./scripts/example.pl.

If things are broken:
    Go to System Preferences -> Growl -> General 
          'enable logging'
